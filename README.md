# a-content-based-recommendation-system-for-cosmetics.
The project aims to create a content-based recommendation system for cosmetics.
By analyzing the chemical components of cosmetic products, the system will predict which products may be suitable for users with specific skin types. 
The project involves tokenizing ingredient lists, creating a document-term matrix, applying t-SNE for dimension reduction, and visualizing the results using Bokeh. 
This will help users make informed decisions when purchasing cosmetics and avoid potential skin irritations.
